# Upload-Application

For an in depth description of the Pseudotime code, please see 'Overview of Pseudotime Analysis Application.pdf'. The necessary packages can be seen in sessionInfo(). A copy of the thesis associated with this project is available here.

'tcell_libs_raw_dash.R' contains the functions to produce the objects to be loaded by the application ('app.R'). These objects are not pre-processed and are created by the user. See ' Upload Application Steps.pdf' for amore in-depth look at the steps to run the Upload Application. 

The working directory should be changed in the code to load/save files (setwd()). It can be done on line 4 of app.R
